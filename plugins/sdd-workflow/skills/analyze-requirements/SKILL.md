# Analyze Requirements

Analyzes use case diagrams or business requirements to extract structured requirements lists.

## Purpose

This skill extracts and categorizes requirements into:

- **User Requirements (UR)** - What users want the system to do
- **Functional Requirements (FR)** - Functions the system must provide
- **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)** - Quality attributes (performance, security, etc.)

## Hybrid Approach

This skill operates in two modes:

| Mode                      | Behavior | Description                                                      |
|:--------------------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Interactive** (default) | Guide    | May ask clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements        |
| **CI (`--ci`)**           | Silent   | No user interaction, makes reasonable assumptions automatically  |

## Prerequisites

**Read the following references:**

- `references/usecase_diagram_guide.md` - Use case diagram notation (for parsing input)

**Read project principles if available:**

- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/${SDD_ROOT}/CONSTITUTION.md` - Project principles (optional, for principle alignment)

## Input

$ARGUMENTS

| Argument     | Required | Description                                                      |
|:-------------|:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `input-text` | Yes      | Use case diagram text, business requirements, or feature name   |
| `--ci`       | -        | CI/non-interactive mode. Skips clarifying questions             |

### Input Examples

See `examples/usecase_diagram_input.md` for detailed input formats with Mermaid diagrams.

**Quick examples:** `/analyze-requirements task-management`, `/analyze-requirements task-management --ci`. See `examples/usecase_diagram_input.md` for more.

When a feature name is provided, look for:
- `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/${SDD_REQUIREMENT_PATH}/{feature-name}.md` - Existing PRD
- Use case diagrams within the PRD

## Generation Rules

### 1. Input Analysis

> **CI Mode**: Skip clarifying questions. Make reasonable assumptions for ambiguous items.

Parse the input to identify:

| Item | Source |
|:-----|:-------|
| **Actors** | From use case diagram or requirements text |
| **Use Cases** | From use case diagram or requirements text |
| **Relationships** | Include/extend relationships between use cases |
| **Business Context** | Background information if available |

### 2. Requirement Extraction

For each use case and context, derive:

1. **User Requirements (UR)**
   - High-level goals from user perspective
   - What value users expect
   - ID format: `UR-xxx`

2. **Functional Requirements (FR)**
   - Specific functions to fulfill user requirements
   - Derived from use cases
   - ID format: `FR-xxx`

3. **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**
   - Performance requirements
   - Security requirements
   - Usability requirements
   - Reliability requirements
   - ID format: `NFR-xxx`

### 3. Requirement Attributes

For each requirement, specify:

| Attribute | Values | Description |
|:----------|:-------|:------------|
| **Priority** | Must / Should / Could / Won't | MoSCoW prioritization |
| **Risk** | High / Medium / Low | Implementation risk level |
| **Verification** | Test / Analysis / Demonstration / Inspection | How to verify |

### 4. Traceability

Establish relationships between requirements:

| Relationship | From | To | Description |
|:-------------|:-----|:---|:------------|
| **derives** | FR | UR | Functional requirement derived from user requirement |
| **contains** | Parent | Child | Parent requirement contains child requirements |
| **traces** | NFR | FR | Non-functional requirement traces to functional requirement |

### 5. Validate

Check Quality Checks items before returning output.
- If issues found: Fix and repeat from step 2

## Output Format

**IMPORTANT**: This skill returns text only. It does NOT write files.

Return the markdown structure defined in `references/output_format.md` (UR/FR/NFR tables plus a Requirements Summary table).

The caller (generate-prd or user) is responsible for saving the output to a file if needed.

## Quality Checks

Before returning output, verify:

- [ ] All use cases are covered by functional requirements
- [ ] Each FR traces to at least one UR
- [ ] Priorities are assigned consistently
- [ ] Risk levels reflect implementation complexity
- [ ] Verification methods are appropriate for requirement type
- [ ] No duplicate requirements
- [ ] IDs are unique and sequential

## Notes

### Requirements Writing

- Focus on WHAT the system must do, not HOW
- Keep requirements atomic and testable
- Avoid implementation details in requirement descriptions
- Use active voice (e.g., "System shall..." or "User can...")
- Ensure requirements are measurable where possible

### Integration

- This skill is typically called by `/generate-prd --ci` with `--ci` flag
- Output is text only; the caller is responsible for file operations
- When called standalone (Interactive mode), suggest next step: `/generate-requirements-diagram`
- In CI mode, makes reasonable assumptions for ambiguous requirements
