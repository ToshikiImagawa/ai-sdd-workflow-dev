# Technical Design Document Template (Design Doc)

This document is a template for creating Technical Design Documents under `.sdd/specification/`.
The filename should be `{feature-name}_design.md`.

> **Note**: This template is a fallback for the plugin.
> When using in a project, customize it according to your programming language and project structure,
> and save it as `.sdd/DESIGN_DOC_TEMPLATE.md`.

## Difference from Abstract Specification

| Document        | SDD Phase         | Role and Focus                                                                                     | Abstraction           |
|-----------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `xxx_spec.md`   | **Specify**       | **"What to build" "Why to build"** - Defines abstract structure and behavior. No technical details | High (Abstract)       |
| `xxx_design.md` | **Plan (Design)** | **"How to implement"** - Concrete technical design. Ensures design decision transparency           | Medium-Low (Concrete) |

# Pseudocode Completeness Rules

Pseudocode in Design Docs (code examples for data models, interface definitions, processing flows, etc.)
must remain **complete enough to be copied verbatim and still work**.
When details diverge during transcription to implementation, they cause review findings and runtime errors.

Select, adapt, and extend the following according to the languages used in your project
(keep the structure extensible with sub-sections for TypeScript / Go / Rust, etc.).

## Python (General)

- Make all import statements explicit (including types referenced only in type annotations)
- Be careful with `isinstance` checks and the BaseException hierarchy
  (`asyncio.CancelledError` is not a subclass of `Exception` in Python 3.8+)
- When `x` in `x if x else fallback` can be `""` / `[]` / `0`,
  write `x if x is not None else fallback` explicitly

## Pydantic v2

- When reassigning inside `model_validator(mode='after')` on a model with `frozen=True`,
  use `object.__setattr__(self, ...)`
- `default_factory` is evaluated after `mode='before'` validators (mind the ordering)

## SQLAlchemy / alembic

- Keep alembic revision IDs ≤ 32 characters (`alembic_version.version_num` is `varchar(32)`)
- Write CHECK constraints with conditions that do not block transitions (use auxiliary columns)

# Customization Guidelines for Projects

When customizing this template for your project, update the following:

1. **Data model notation**: Adjust to project's programming language
2. **Interface definition notation**: Adjust to project's programming language
3. **Change history code examples**: Adjust to project's programming language
4. **Module structure table columns**: Adjust to project's structure (package/module organization)
5. **Technology stack table**: Adjust to technology areas used in the project
6. **Pseudocode completeness rules**: Select and extend rules according to the pitfalls of the languages and frameworks used in the project

---

**This Design Doc serves as the guideline for concrete code generation that AI agents reference during the Implement
phase.**
