## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.0] - 2026-07-16

### Added

#### Agents

- **`cross-prd-reviewer`** - New agent that reviews consistency across multiple PRDs
    - Checks category boundary consistency (scope-out cross-references), terminology alignment across
      glossaries, structure and notation style uniformity, CONSTITUTION.md principle reference coverage,
      and front matter labeling consistency
    - Findings are classified as [must]/[recommend]/[nits]; single-PRD quality remains prd-reviewer's role
    - Adds `templates/{en,ja}/cross_prd_review_output.md` output templates

#### Configuration

- **`.sdd-config.json` `index`** - New boolean setting that controls the compressed `.sdd` document index
  built at session start to reduce token consumption
    - **Enabled by default** (`true`). Set `"index": false` to opt out
    - Auto-generated `.sdd-config.json` now includes `"index": true` explicitly for discoverability
    - **Index extraction expansion** - The index now also covers SysML requirement diagrams and data model
      fields, so the SysML trace axis that previously required raw reads is included in the token-reduction index

### Changed

#### Configuration

- **`.sdd-config.json` `index`** - Value format is now **boolean-only** (`true`/`false`); the previous
  string form (`"on"`/`"off"`) is no longer supported. A non-boolean value is rejected with a warning and
  falls back to the default (on)
    - The default changed from **off to on**, so the token-reduction index is built out of the box

#### Hooks

- **`PreToolUse`** - Injects `.sdd/CONSTITUTION.md` principles as `additionalContext` when Write/Edit
  targets implementation source code
    - Injection is limited to source-file edits inside the project, happens at most once per session,
      and is truncated to 3000 characters to avoid context bloat
    - Nothing is injected when CONSTITUTION.md does not exist

#### Agents

- **`front-matter-reviewer`** - Changed `model` from `sonnet` to `haiku`
    - Rule-based format validation does not require complex reasoning; a lightweight model reduces cost and latency
    - Other agents (prd-reviewer, spec-reviewer, requirement-analyzer, clarification-assistant) keep `sonnet`

#### Skills

- **Model tiers** - Reduced the model for mechanical / rule-based skills to cut cost and latency
    - `generate-requirements-diagram` / `generate-usecase-diagram` - `agent` changed from `sonnet` to `haiku`
    - `recommend-front-matter` / `run-checklist` / `sdd-init` / `task-cleanup` - now declare `agent: haiku`
- **`sdd-init`** / **SessionStart hook** - Moved the detailed AI-SDD guide out of the always-loaded
  `CLAUDE.md` into a path-scoped rule `.claude/rules/ai-sdd-instructions.md` (loads only under `.sdd/**`)
  to cut context usage during work that does not touch `.sdd/`
    - `CLAUDE.md` now keeps only the declaration, trigger conditions, and a pointer to the rule;
      the ~90-line directory-structure / naming / link-convention block moved to the rule file
    - The rule file is created and version-synced automatically by the SessionStart hook
      (`session-start.py`); `/sdd-init` (`update-claude-md.sh`) only maintains the minimal `CLAUDE.md` section
    - The rule is a single English file (agent-facing guidance, not human-facing) regardless of `SDD_LANG`,
      so no per-language rule files ever load together
      because they require cross-document consistency reasoning

#### Skills

- Introduced named skill arguments via the `arguments` frontmatter field (Claude Code v2.1.199+)
    - 8 skills (`task-breakdown`, `implement`, `clarify`, `check-spec`, `checklist`, `run-checklist`,
      `task-cleanup`, `plan-refactor`) now declare `feature-name` / `ticket-number` as named positional
      arguments and reference them via `$name` substitution in the skill body
    - Free-text-input skills (`generate-spec`, `generate-prd`, etc.) keep interpreting the whole
      `$ARGUMENTS` string
    - Each skill body documents a fallback: when a value is empty, unsubstituted, or a positionally
      captured flag (`--...`), the skill falls back to interpreting the full argument string or asking
      the user interactively, preserving pre-v2.1.199 behavior

### Added

#### Hooks

- Expanded `hooks.json` beyond `SessionStart`
    - **`UserPromptSubmit`** (`scripts/user-prompt-submit.py`) - Detects Vibe Coding signals (vague instructions such
      as "make it nice" / "いい感じに") in the user prompt and injects additional context prompting a vibe-detector
      style clarification flow (detection only, never blocks)
    - **`PreToolUse`** (`scripts/pre-tool-use.py`, matcher `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) - Validates AI-SDD file naming
      conventions before writing under `.sdd/` (requirement: no suffix, specification: `_spec.md` / `_design.md`
      required) and blocks violating writes
    - **`PostToolUse`** (`scripts/post-tool-use.py`, matcher `Write|Edit|MultiEdit`) - Detects potential document
      update omissions: reminds to run consistency checks after `.sdd/` document edits, and reminds to sync the
      design doc after editing a source file with a matching `*_design.md`

#### Agents

- **`requirement-analyzer`** - Added ID numbering validation (`--validate-ids`, also runs as part of `--analyze`)
    - Naming convention validation via configurable regex patterns (`id_conventions` section in `.sdd-config.json`)
    - Ascending order validation with move suggestions for out-of-order ID sequences
    - Numbering gap detection and stale-ID detection after renames
    - Added "ID Numbering Validation" section to `requirement_analysis_output` templates (en/ja)

#### Documentation

- **`AI-SDD-PRINCIPLES`** - Documented the optional `id_conventions` section of `.sdd-config.json`

#### Skills

- **`check-spec`** (v3.1.0) - Extended consistency check to literal values
    - Parses the spec's "Value Range / Threshold Registry" (Schema Registry) section when present, with fallback to
      extracting literal values from spec/design body text
    - Extracts implementation-side literals from config files, ORM CHECK constraints, validation constraints
      (e.g., Pydantic), and language-specific enums/constants
    - Detects value drift across spec / design / implementation and reports it as a Warning
      (e.g., spec `0.7` vs `config.py` `0.6`)
    - Verifies enum / CHECK constraint member-set completeness and requirement ID trace completeness
      (PRD <-> spec <-> design)
    - Added value drift sections to output templates (en/ja)
- **`generate-spec`** - Added "Pseudocode Completeness Rules" section to design doc templates (`templates/{en,ja}/design_template.md`)
    - Language-specific guidance (Python general / Pydantic v2 / SQLAlchemy & alembic) to keep design pseudocode copyable verbatim
    - Extensible sub-section structure for additional languages (TypeScript / Go / Rust, etc.)

### Fixed

- **Custom `.sdd-config.json` `root` (and directory names) are now honored across the plugin.** Previously
  many paths were hardcoded to the default `.sdd/`, so projects using a custom root silently broke.
    - `session-start.py` substitutes the configured root into the generated path-scoped rule's `paths:` glob,
      so `.claude/rules/ai-sdd-instructions.md` auto-loads under a customized root (e.g. `.ai-docs/`) — this
      also fixes the regression where the glob was baked to `.sdd/**`
    - `update-claude-md.sh` substitutes the configured root into the generated `CLAUDE.md` section
    - Skill/agent prompts and output templates now resolve SDD paths via `${SDD_ROOT}` / `${SDD_*_PATH}`
      instead of literal `.sdd/...`
    - `find-design-docs.sh` and `validate-files.sh` write their cache under the configured root; `pre-tool-use.py`
      naming-violation messages report the configured directory paths
- **`post-tool-use.py`** - The advisory hint shown after editing `.sdd/requirement/` or `.sdd/specification/`
  files now also suggests `/constitution validate`, not just the `doc-consistency-checker` skill, so
  CONSTITUTION.md principle violations are more likely to be caught after generation/edits
- **`doc-consistency-checker`** - Removed the `design ↔ Implementation` check (former spec FR-004), which
  duplicated `impl-spec-check` (`/check-spec`) and contradicted the parent PRD's explicit scope-out for that
  check. `design ↔ Implementation` consistency is now handled exclusively by `/check-spec`
- **Section requirement markers in generated output** - Prevented author-facing section requirement
  markers (`<MUST>` / `<RECOMMENDED>` / `<OPTIONAL>`) from leaking into generated documents. `generate-spec`
  now strips them from headings in the final output, and `prd-reviewer` / `spec-reviewer` gained a
  "No Marker Residue" check that flags any residual markers

## [3.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### Changed

#### Hooks

- **`session-start`** - Migrated `session-start.sh` (Bash) to `session-start.py` (Python 3.7+)
    - Eliminated `jq` dependency by using Python's built-in `json` module
    - Unified script across `sdd-workflow` and `sdd-workflow-ja` via `--default-lang` argument
    - `sdd-workflow-ja/scripts/` is now a symlink to `sdd-workflow/scripts/` (deduplication)
    - Added error handling for invalid `.sdd-config.json` (graceful fallback to defaults)
    - Requires Python 3.7+ (for `dataclasses` and `subprocess.run(capture_output=True)`)

#### Documentation

- Added `README.ja.md` as the Japanese README for `sdd-workflow` plugin

## [3.0.2] - 2026-02-09

### Fixed

- **`sdd-init`** - Fixed language setting inheritance from `.sdd-config.json`
    - `update-claude-md.sh` now reads `SDD_LANG` directly from `.sdd-config.json` instead of relying on environment
      variable
    - Previously, when `lang: "ja"` was set in `.sdd-config.json`, the `## AI-SDD Instructions` section in `CLAUDE.md`
      was incorrectly generated in English
    - Root cause: `CLAUDE_ENV_FILE` writes from `init-structure.sh` were not reflected in the same shell session when
      `update-claude-md.sh` ran
