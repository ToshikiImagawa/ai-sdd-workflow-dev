"""naming.py - Single source of truth for AI-SDD file naming conventions.

The AI-SDD naming rule:
- requirement/: plain ``.md`` files; a ``_spec`` / ``_design`` suffix is forbidden
  (it must stay distinguishable from specification/ by name alone).
- specification/ and adr/: single-type directories (every file is an abstract
  spec / a decision log respectively), so a ``_spec``/``_design``/``-decisions``
  suffix is optional. Existing suffixed files remain valid; new files may omit it.

Consumed by the pre-tool-use hook (write-time validation via ``validate_naming``)
and the recommend-front-matter skill (document classification via
``determine_type``), so the rule is defined exactly once.
